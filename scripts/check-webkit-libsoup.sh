#
# TEMPORARY (stem#1528, seed#2930): Playwright 1.63's WebKit bundles libsoup
# 3.6.5, which has a use-after-free (microsoft/playwright#42803) that loses the
# session mid-run on WebKit only. The WebKit E2E job runs on Ubuntu 26.04 so the
# build loads the OS's 3.6.6 instead; this check proves it did. Delete this
# script with the WebKit job split when Playwright 1.64 lands.
#
# The WebKit build is the one ui/'s @playwright/test resolves, not whatever
# sits in the browser cache. The network process is the one that links
# libsoup; it is resolved with the same LD_LIBRARY_PATH the MiniBrowser wrapper
# sets, so a bundled sys/lib copy wins over the system one exactly as it does
# at run time.
