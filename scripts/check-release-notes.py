"""check-release-notes.py — a tag's contents must match its changelog entry.

v0.24.161 shipped #1477 and its CHANGELOG section never mentions it, and
v0.24.154 and v0.24.155 lost #1442 and #1448 the same way (stem#1197): a commit
merged while the release PR was open, the queue built the release PR on top of
it, and release-please could not regenerate a PR whose branch the queue had
locked. The arm-time freshness check in release-please.yml narrows that window
but cannot close it, because it runs before the PR enters the queue.

Nothing self-corrects afterwards. The next release compares against the new
tag, so a commit missed here is missing from the changelog permanently.

Every commit between the previous tag and this one must be mentioned in this
version's CHANGELOG section, matched on its PR number, which release-please
always writes.

The post-tag form reports the loss but cannot prevent it. `--pending` runs
the same comparison against the working tree before release-please's PR is
merged, so a commit the merge queue swept in ejects the release PR instead of
shipping inside its tag.

Usage:
  scripts/check-release-notes.py               # newest tag
  scripts/check-release-notes.py v0.24.161     # a specific tag
  scripts/check-release-notes.py --pending     # an untagged release in the tree
