# check-filename-policy.sh — capability-package file-naming gate.
#
# The flat internal/api package uses filename prefixes (handlers_, jobs_) to
# separate concerns within one large package. Those prefixes are meaningful
# *only* there. Once code is decomposed into a dedicated capability package
# (internal/<cap>/), the package declaration already supplies that context, so
# the prefix becomes stutter: internal/health/handlers_health_api.go re-states
# "health" twice and re-asserts a layer fact the package name already makes.
#
# Best practice in a decomposed package is to name files for their role *within*
# the package (health.go, checks.go, handler.go) — never by re-stating the layer
# (handlers_/jobs_) or the capability the package itself already represents.
# This is not a Go *language* rule (the toolchain accepts these names); it is an
# architecture-consistency rule that keeps the internal/api strangle honest:
# monolith vocabulary stays in the monolith and is dropped on the way out.
#
# This gate fails if any handlers_*.go / jobs_*.go file exists outside
# internal/api, UNLESS the file's own package directory is named for that token
# (e.g. internal/platform/jobs/jobs.go is the eponymous file of package `jobs`,
# and jobs_test.go is its standard test — both idiomatic, not monolith baggage).
# The gate is green on the current tree and only fires when a decomposition
# carries the monolith's grouping prefix forward instead of dropping it.
#
# Run locally: scripts/check-filename-policy.sh
