# CI/CD Pipeline

The CI pipeline runs on every push and PR. **All checks must pass.**

Every job except `changes` is gated on the `changes` job's path filters, so a
docs-only PR does not pay for a Go build. `ci-complete` is the single required
status check — it depends on every other job, so adding a job to `ci.yml`
without adding it to `ci-complete`'s `needs:` list makes that job advisory.

## GitHub Actions Workflows

### ci.yml - Main CI Pipeline

| Job | Description | Checks |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `changes` | Path filtering | Decides which downstream jobs run |
| `build-ui` | Shared UI build | Builds `internal/api/ui/` once for `backend`/`race` to download |
| `backend` | Go checks | lint, vet, staticcheck, fmt, tests, coverage floor |
| `race` | Go race detector | `go test -race`, split from `backend` so it fails distinctly |
| `frontend` | React/TS checks | tsc typecheck, Biome, Vite build, Vitest, Storybook build |
| `c-lint` | C dataplane lint (C23) | clang-format, clang-tidy |
| `dataplane-safety` | C memory safety | ASAN + fuzz targets |
| `security` | Security scans | govulncheck (hard gate), gosec, npm audit, gitleaks, Trivy |
| `semgrep` | SAST | Semgrep rules |
| `quality` | Code quality gates | banned vocabulary, file size ratchet, output escaping, sensitive files |
| `workflow-lint` | Workflow static analysis | actionlint; zizmor (blocks on High) |
| `i18n` | Internationalization | Catalog completeness, no translated standard terms |
| `docs` | Documentation | Markdown lint (blocking, scoped to changed files) |
| `build` | Build verification | Multi-arch binaries with full ldflags |
| `darwin-compile-check` | macOS cross-compile | arm64 compile only |
| `e2e` | Browser tests | Playwright, chromium + webkit (browsers cached) |
| `ci-complete` | Aggregate gate | The required status check |

### Other Workflows

| Workflow | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `codeql.yml` | CodeQL security analysis (Go, JS/TS) |
| `dead-code.yml` | Weekly dead code detection |
| `docs-link-check.yml` | Weekly external link check (split out of `ci.yml`) |
| `label-sync.yml` | Sync label definitions |
| `labeler.yml` | Auto-label PRs and issues |
| `license-check.yml` | Verify dependency licenses |
| `pr-body-lint.yml` | Enforce the PR body template |
| `release-please.yml` | Automated version management and release PRs |
| `release.yml` | goreleaser release builds, signing, provenance |
| `scorecard.yml` | OpenSSF Scorecard |
| `title-lint.yml` | Lint PR and issue titles |
| `todo-tracker.yml` | Weekly TODO tracking |

## Workflow security

`workflow-lint` runs two scanners over `.github/workflows/` itself:

- **actionlint** — syntax, expression and shell errors inside `run:` blocks.
  It catches things a plain YAML parse does not, including duplicate `with:`
  keys, which `yaml.safe_load` accepts silently by keeping the last one.
  `SC2129` is ignored as a pure style preference; every correctness rule stays on.
- **zizmor** (pinned 1.29.0) — Actions security scanner, run against the whole
  `.github/workflows/` directory. **Blocks on High findings.** The repo sits
  at zero High. One finding elsewhere in the directory (`release-please.yml`)
  survived review and carries a `# zizmor: ignore[...]` comment with the
  reasoning inline; anything else that reaches High fails the build.
  Low/Informational are reported but not yet enforced.

Permissions follow least privilege: workflows declare `permissions: {}` (or
`contents: read`) at the top level and grant scopes per job. A new job that
needs a write scope declares it on the job, never workflow-wide. `release.yml`
deliberately runs without npm caching, because its output is published and
attested and a restored cache entry could land inside a signed artifact; it
opts out by passing `cache: ""` to the `setup-node` composite action.

## The Node.js pin lives in one file

Every workflow that needs Node uses `./.github/actions/setup-node`; none pin a
`node-version:` literal. The composite is the single place the Node and npm
versions are declared, and it must stay in step with `.nvmrc` and the `engines` /
`packageManager` fields in `package.json`. Release and CI therefore build on the
same Node version by construction rather than by convention.

## CI Must Pass Before Merge

`main` is protected. Push a feature branch, open a PR, and let CI gate it:

```bash
gh pr create --fill
gh pr merge --auto --squash --delete-branch
```

Fix issues locally first:

```bash
make all       # Full local verification
make verify    # lint, test, security, build
make test-e2e  # Playwright E2E (requires the backend running)
```

## Running CI Checks Locally

### Backend

```bash
make lint-go           # golangci-lint v2.13.1
make test-backend      # Go tests
make test-coverage     # Coverage report
make security-backend  # gosec + govulncheck
```

### Frontend

```bash
make lint-frontend     # Biome
make test-frontend     # Vitest
make ui                # Vite build into internal/api/ui/
```

### C dataplane

```bash
make lint-c            # clang-tidy (Linux only)
make c-test            # C unit tests
make c-test-asan       # AddressSanitizer + UBSan
make c-fuzz            # libFuzzer + ASAN over the packet parser
```

### Security

```bash
make security          # All security scans
make security-secrets  # gitleaks
make security-trivy    # Trivy
```

### Workflows

```bash
actionlint -ignore 'SC2129'
zizmor --min-severity high .github/workflows/
```
