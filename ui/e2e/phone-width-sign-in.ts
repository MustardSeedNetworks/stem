/**
 * The phone-width gate's setup-command (MustardSeedNetworks/.github
 * phone-width.yml): sign the E2E daemon in and write BASE_URL's session to
 * STORAGE_STATE, so the gate visits each route signed in rather than judging
 * the login screen.
 *
 * The browser comes from the gate's own Playwright, not ui/'s: the gate
 * installs a build for its pinned driver only and passes that driver's
 * node_modules as NODE_PATH. require() is anchored THERE, because resolving
 * from this file finds ui/node_modules/playwright first — a different version
 * whose browser the runner does not have. Run under plain `node`, so imports
 * carry `.ts`.
